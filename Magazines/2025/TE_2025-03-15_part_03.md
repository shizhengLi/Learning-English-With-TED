*Ideas that emerged from the University of Chicago in the 1960s changed the world. But as a new film shows, they almost didn’t*

**W**HAT PROMPTS a revolution? When it comes to investing, no

change has been as great as that which began with researchers at

the University of Chicago in the 1960s. Their financial-theory

revolution changed the way that almost everyone invests, and made

speculators many trillions of dollars.

是什么引发了一场革命？谈到投资，没有什么变化比得上20世纪60年代芝加哥大学研究人员开创的变化。他们的金融理论革命改变了几乎所有人的投资方式，让投机者赚了数万亿美元。



原文：

The transformation is the subject of “Tune Out the Noise”, a

documentary by Errol Morris, an Academy Award winner, which

held its premiere in New York on March 6th. His film includes

interviews with academics and investors, such as Eugene Fama,

Myron Scholes and David Booth, who took ideas about market

efficiency and diversification from the textbook and put them into

practice in the markets. This led to a surge in the use of data and a

disciplined focus on costs, in turn providing the foundation for

modern passive investing.

这种转变是奥斯卡奖得主埃罗尔·莫里斯的纪录片《远离噪音》的主题，该片于3月6日在纽约举行了首映式。他的电影包括对学者和投资者的采访，如尤金·法玛、迈伦·斯克尔斯和大卫·布斯，他们从教科书中吸取了关于市场效率和多样化的思想，并在市场上付诸实践。这导致了数据使用的激增和对成本的严格关注，进而为现代被动投资提供了基础。



原文：

Mr Morris’s film may, in theory, be about brilliant individuals, but

its most powerful message is about the role played by chance.

History, like markets, is affected by randomness, and luck brought

together the right people at the right time. Each had to be present

for the financial revolution to emerge.

理论上，莫里斯先生的电影可能是关于杰出的个人，但它最有力的信息是关于偶然扮演的角色。历史就像市场一样，受到随机性的影响，而运气在正确的时间将正确的人聚集在一起。每个人都必须在场，金融革命才会出现。

原文：

The University of Chicago’s role is just about the only part of the

story that happened by design. It had become the nexus for

financial research owing to its reputation for excellence in

economics. The Centre for Research in Security Prices was

established there in 1960, and its wealth of data on the price of

bonds and stocks over decades enabled the academics to do their

work.

芝加哥大学的角色是这个故事中唯一被设计的部分。由于其在经济学方面的卓越声誉，它已成为金融研究的中心点。证券价格研究中心于1960年在那里成立，其数十年来债券和股票价格的丰富数据使学者们能够开展工作。

原文：

Randomness is apparent just about everywhere else. Although Mr

Fama, who would later win a Nobel prize for his work on asset

pricing, completed a doctorate at Chicago in 1964, he almost never

made it to the university. After completing an undergraduate

education at Tufts University, he had to chase up his application to

Chicago, discovering that it had never been received. On phoning

the university, he reached the dean of students by chance, who told

him about a scholarship for Tufts graduates, before offering it to

him on the spot.

随机性几乎在其他任何地方都显而易见。尽管法马先生（Mr. Fama）后来因其在资产定价方面的研究获得了诺贝尔奖，并于1964年在芝加哥大学完成了博士学位，但他差点没能进入这所大学。在塔夫茨大学完成本科教育后，他不得不追查自己提交给芝加哥大学的申请，结果发现申请从未被接收。在给大学打电话时，他偶然联系上了学生事务主任，主任告诉他有一个针对塔夫茨大学毕业生的奖学金，并当场就将这个奖学金提供给了他。

It was a similar story for Mr Scholes, another future Nobel laureate.

In the summer of 1963 he started a job as a computer programmer

despite scant expertise. The six other programmers who were hired

failed to show up for the job, leaving Mr Scholes alone to assist in

the financial research of other academics. He took to the work,

abandoning his plan to return to his family’s book-publishing

company, and was in time offered a place on the university’s

doctoral programme.

对另一位未来的诺贝尔奖得主斯科尔斯来说，情况类似。1963年夏天，尽管缺乏专业知识，他还是开始了计算机程序员的工作。其他六名被雇佣的程序员没有来应聘，留下斯科尔斯一个人去协助其他学者的金融研究。他开始从事这项工作，放弃了回到家族图书出版公司的计划，并及时获得了该大学博士项目的一个名额。

原文：

Mr Booth, whose name now adorns Chicago’s business school, and

Rex Sinquefield, his business partner, put the academic ideas into

practice by co-founding Dimensional Fund Advisors, a firm that

today boasts $777bn in assets under management. In 1969 Mr

Booth narrowly avoided being made to fight in the Vietnam war,

when a lenient officer postponed his conscription since he planned

to study for a PhD. Mr Sinquefield did serve in the armed forces

during the war, but poor eyesight kept him from combat.

如今，布斯的名字装饰在芝加哥大学商学院(Chicago's business school)上，他和他的商业伙伴雷克斯辛克菲尔德(Rex Sinquefield)共同创立了Dimensional Fund Advisors，将学术理念付诸实践。如今，这家公司号称管理着7770亿美元的资产。1969年，布思先生侥幸避免参加越南战争，当时一名仁慈的军官推迟了他的征兵，因为他计划攻读博士学位。辛克菲尔德先生确实在战争期间服过役，但视力不佳使他无法参加战斗。

adorns：装饰；（adorn的第三人称单数）

原文:

A few twists of fate—an unanswered phone call, a prickly

recruiting officer, more diligent computer programmers or better

eyesight—would have prevented some of the men from reaching

Chicago. Without the confluence of thought, investing might look

very different today, making the world much poorer.

一些命运的转折——一个无人接听的电话，一个易怒的招聘官员，更勤奋的电脑程序员或者更好的视力——会阻止一些人到达芝加哥。如果没有思想的融合，今天的投资可能会大不相同，让世界变得更加贫穷。

学习：

prickly：易怒的；易生气的；

confluence：（河流的）汇合处；交汇处；汇合点；合流；汇集；聚合

Such happenstance is found elsewhere, too: other parts of

economics and nuclear physics, for instance, relied upon the

concentration of talent in America after geniuses, often Jewish, fled

from the Nazis. In the 1950s Silicon Valley looked to be an

unlikely home for the American tech industry, with corporate

research mostly taking place on the east coast. That changed in

large part because William Shockley, an inventor of transistor

technology, set up his own firm in the San Francisco Bay Area. The

company’s employees went on to establish giants including

Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel. Shockley had picked the area

simply because he wanted to be close to his elderly mother.

这种偶然事件在其他地方也能找到:例如，经济学和核物理的其他部分依赖于天才(通常是犹太人)逃离纳粹后美国人才的集中。20世纪50年代，硅谷看起来不像是美国科技产业的家园，企业研究大多发生在东海岸。这在很大程度上改变了，因为晶体管技术的发明者威廉姆·肖克利在旧金山湾区成立了自己的公司。该公司的员工后来建立了包括仙童半导体和英特尔在内的巨头。肖克利选择这个地区仅仅是因为他想靠近他年迈的母亲。
